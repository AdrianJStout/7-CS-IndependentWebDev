- After you have produced your page, you'll want to share it with the World. 
- BGS students have Intranet space over on our =studentweb= server, where they can create and share pages that can only be seen by devices connected to our network (e.g. on your 'phone, if you use our WiFi)
- To transfer your work to the web server, follow this guide:

*Gold*
  - Publish your webpage along with your external css file to the student web.
  - Test your webpage and style sheet work by opening it in a browser:
    https://studentweb/~04xe11 (replace 04xe11 with your own login ID)

*Platinum*
  - All the above, but with two linked webpages which use an external CSS file and all images used worked correctly.


- Once you have published your work, send your website link to your friends and ask your friend give you some feedback. 
- After your friend had a look at your website, take this [[https://www.bournetolearn.com/quizzes/y7-webIndDev/Lesson_5/index.php][sef-assessment]] quiz with your friend. 

*Literacy* 
  - After you have done publishing your website and your friend had given you some feedback, write a 200 words =self evaluation= of your website.
    - what is good about it in general?
    - is the disign appropriate for the content and the intended audience?
    - is the choice of fonts, images, or colour appropriate for the designed website?
    - what is the feedback your friend gave you and what do you think about the feedback?
    - what is not so good about it and why?
    - if you are going to start it all over again, what will you do differently and why?
- Upload your written evaluation to bournetolearn.com
