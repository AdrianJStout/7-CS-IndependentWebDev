** Homework 1 - use of images
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:

- You have used images in your webpages.
- You also learned how to specify size of an image so it will fit with your overall webpage design.
- There are two types of images: vector and bitmap
- Your homework will be as following:
  1. Research what those two types of images are with examples.
  2. The advantages and disadvantges of each.
  3. When is better to use one type over the other.

** Homework 2 - On the border
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:

- We have learned adding border to a DIV
- You can also add a shadow to a DIV to make it look floating like this one below:
  #+BEGIN_HTML

<div style=" width: 300px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: lightblue;
    box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;"></div>

  #+END_HTML
	
- Take a look at[[https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp][ this website]] on how to add shadow to a DIV by using CSS style like the following:
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
   #topbox { 
       width: 800px;
       height: 150px;
       background-color: lightblue;
       box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;
   }
  #+END_SRC
- your homework:
  - explain what each of the numbers means after the box-shadow. For example, what does each of the =10px 10px 5px  #88888= mean?
** Homework 3 - Literacy Task
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Websites are meant to be published online for everyone to see.
- Companies try very hard to get their websites to show up on Google search to attract traffic to their sites.
- One way to do this is to have a domain name that is easier to remember, like the bournetocode.com.
- Research online to find out at least 3 ways websites can improve their ranking on Google search. Write your result in good English with at least 150 words.
